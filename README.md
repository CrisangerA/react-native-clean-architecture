# React Native Clean Architecture Template

**ðŸ‘¾ Simple and minimalist template that includes styling system, design system and customizable components. Developed with a modular architecture structure focused on maintainability and scalability.**

This template allows you to initialize a new react native application and saves you a lot of time in the initial configuration of the application with things that all applications usually need such as: components, styles, customizable measures, forms, validations, architecture.

_It also includes base modules for user, authentication and navigation to serve as an example of how to work with this template._
